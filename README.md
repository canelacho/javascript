# Why I love Javascript!!!

A long time ago, I started develop for the web with ASP and PHP but I was looking for a language to make great things. At that time, there was not way to do things in the Back-end and the Front-end with just one language, but with the time, javascript was growing and when the time came, NodeJS appeared and everything change. The only language who offers me to work in the Front-end and the Backend was Javascript.  It is everywhere, is nice, have a lot of people collaborating around the world... it was easy, don't you think? The choosed one was JS.

Today I consider myself as a Fullstack developer, JS evangelizer and lover of JS Technology, I enjoy a lot share with others my knowledge and teach how to use it!

I use MEVN Stack but maybe tomorrow I'll be using other JS stuff because I'm always learning and improving myself, and of course, I'm always open to new technologies.

This is July 2018, I will try to use the latest functions, methods and options in JS. This help me to memorize details and structures. Repeating is the best way to remember something and improve your learning. If you find this information in the future, maybe isn't new stuff but belive me, right now this features are so cool and make our lives easier!

If you want to watch the videos go to ["Canelacho's Youtube Channel"](https://www.temp.com)  - Videos are in Spanish.

- "What is? and Why use strict mode"

- "Methods with Array and Objects" ( filter(), map(), reduce(), foreach(), some(), every(), and others...)
- "Arrow functions"
- "Destructuring Array and Objects" 



What do you need to know before check this material ?
1. We need an Internet Browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox (because you will need use the developers tools like the console to watch the execution of the exercises).
2. Also a text editor like Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, WebStorm, NotePad, Vim, etc... it's up to you but you will need one to watch the files downloaded!.
3. At least you have to know how to download projects from git, obvious, you should download this material.
4. Using this methods you can write clean and redeable code instead of using for, loop or while.
5. Some of this methods are immutable, a good practice to manipulate data. 
6. Enjoy the material!
